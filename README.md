## AI Architecture Explained

The generative AI capabilities are orchestrated using Firebase Genkit flows, which are server-side TypeScript functions that interact with large language models (LLMs).

### AI Flows (`src/ai/flows/`)

1. **`disease-prediction.ts`**: Analyzes plant images for health assessment and disease identification
2. **`treatment-suggestions.ts`**: Provides conventional and traditional treatment recommendations
3. **`kisan-assistant.ts`**: Powers the interactive chatbot for follow-up questions
4. **`smart-location.ts`**: Handles intelligent location detection and weather data routing
